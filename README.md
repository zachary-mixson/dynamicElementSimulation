This is the beginning of a physics simulation that has different elements that can be “drawn” onto the screen using the mouse. 
The elements that are implemented into the simulation so far are “water” and “earth”. The earth element is just a 
stationary block that can be drawn to the screen and can be used to create obstacles for the water.  
The technology used for this project was C++ as the primary programing language, SFML (simple fast media library) 
framework, and github as the source control tool. The concepts used while developing this project were the factory design 
pattern to implement the elements with as little coupling as possible.
